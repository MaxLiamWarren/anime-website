						Yuji Itadori is the main protagonist of the Jujutsu

						desire to aide those in need while simultaneously seeing
						the best in others, regardless of what they've done in
						the past. Which is triggered by his grandfather's last
						words to him: "protect those you care about so that when
						you die, you die surrounded by [people] that love you".

					<p>
						Cursed energy is born from negative emotions such as
						grief and anger. These negative feelings are common in
						human society so almost everyone possesses cursed
						energy. If this amount is higher than a certain degree,
						it grants the person the ability to see curses, which is
						very rare among the human race.
					</p>

					<p>
						Curses are apparitions manifested entirely from cursed
						energy. Even their bodies are composed of cursed energy,
						making cursed spirits invisible to non-sorcerers.
						Jujutsu related items such as cursed tools, cursed
						objects, and cursed corpses all contain cursed energy.
						The emission of cursed energy from humans collects like
						sediment until a cursed spirit is born from the
						collective negative energy.
					</p>

					<div class="ml">
						<img
							class="img-outline img-flt-r"
							loading="lazy"
							src="./images/example-new-curse.png"
						/>
					</div>

					<p>
						Curses born with strong feelings directed toward a
						certain aspect are especially strong. The stronger
						humanity's fear and anger is directed at cursing a
						certain aspect of the world, like natural disasters, the
						more powerful curses spawned from those negative
						sentiments will be.
					</p>

					<p>
						Proper control over one's emotions is key to channeling
						cursed energy and every jujutsu sorcerer is trained to
						do so. This makes it so sorcerers don't waste their
						power supply even while they're overcome with emotion.
					</p>

					<p>
						Sorcerers leak far less cursed energy than the average
						human. So much so, that if every human were a sorcerer,
						curses would cease to spawn. There are other differences
						in how sorcerers and non-sorcerers use cursed energy due
						to their profession, but the real reason lies in how it
						flows. While cursed energy leaks outward from
						non-sorcerers, it flows heavily within sorcerers which
						keeps it contained.
					</p>

					<p>
						Applying cursed energy to physical attacks can be as
						effective as a cursed technique when it comes to gifted
						combatants who prefer close quarters.
					</p>

					<p>
						Yuji can fight on par with that of a grade 1 sorcerer
						without a technique due to his ability to seemlessly
						imbue his physical attacks with cursed energy.
					</p>

					<p>
						Control over cursed energy requires innate skill and
						vigorous training. In order for Yuji to develop his
						skills, Gojo had him undergo special training that saw
						him controlling his emotions and his cursed energy at
						the same time.
					</p>

					<p>
						Yuji's cursed energy originates from the cursed finger
						that he consume in the opening episode; as that finger
						belonged to the special grade curse, Ryomen Sukuna.

					<p>
						Although Yuji has not developed an innate technique, he
						has shown great proficiency in learning how to control
						cursed energy. Currently, Yuji primarily uses cursed
						energy combined with his martial arts skills and
						superhuman strength. Yuji reinforces his strikes with
						cursed energy, increasing their impact and allowing him
						to hurt curses.

					</div>
					<p>
						Divergent Fist relies on the manipulation of Yuji's
						cursed energy, like all other Jujutsu techniques. It is
						a form of punching technique used by Yuuji in
						close-range fights. The technique involves the
						concentration of cursed energy in his fists while
						landing a blow. While training with Satoru Gojo, it was
						discovered that Yuji's cursed energy has a time lag.
					</p>
					<p>
						The basic principle behind Divergent Fist is a time lag.
						Yuji is exceptionally agile, while also possessing super
						human physical strength. Due to Yuji's enhanced speed
						and reflexes his attacks reach his opponents before he
						is able to apply cursed energy to them. Thus, arises a
						delay or “lag”. He first hits with a bare minimum amount
						of cursed energy, and then the energy comes charging in.
						This means every contact he makes delivers two hits.
					</p>

					<p>
						Since Yuji's speed and raw strength are exceptional, he
						is able to use Divergent Fist. However, most sorcerers
						cannot land such a hit. It proves to be a huge weapon
						for Yuji in his fights as it perfectly complements his
						fighting style.
					</p>

					<div class="ml">
						<img
							class="img-outline img-flt-r-2"
							loading="lazy"
							src="./gif/fist-one.webp"
						/>
					</div>

					<p>
						Yuji first used it against a transfigured human and
						defeated the curse-like creature with the delayed hit.
						He also used this technique all throughout his fight
						with Mahito and attempted to finish the cursed spirit
						off with an extra-powerful shot that used up all Yuji's
						remaining cursed energy.
					</p>

					<p>
						During the Goodwill Event, Yuji fought Aoi Todo with
						Divergent Fist. Aoi believed the technique holds Yuji
						back and revealed he'd never be able to defeat a special
						grade with it.
					</p>

					<p>
						Yuji realizes that he should apply cursed energy at the
						exact moment when his strike hits at full strength. Yuji
						used to channel energy as soon as he made his move,
						making the hit a little weaker. Yuji was focused on
						“flowing” his cursed energy through his body in parts.
						However, the flow of cursed energy should not be thought
						of in terms of flowing to and from individual body
						parts. Instead one must thinl of the body as a whole. As
						a sorcerer becomes more profecient, their cursed energy
						flow becomes harder to predict for this very reason.
					</p>

					<div class="img-flex">
						<img
							class="img-block"
							loading="lazy"
							src="./images/yuji-todo-flex.webp"
						/>
					</div>

					<p>
						Divergent Fist was essentially formed from Yuji's bad
						habits when controlling his cursed energy. After his
						experience with Todo, Yuji's control over his cursed
						energy improved dramatically. He ceased utilizing the
						move until his fight with Choso, in which Yuji learned
						to control Divergent Fist and utilize the secondary
						impact to his advantage.
					</p>

					<p>
						Rather than allowing his cursed energy to lag behind his
						speed, Aoi convinces Yuji to apply cursed energy at the
						moment of impact. Training him to do so eventually
						results in Yuji unlocking the capacity to utilize Black
						Flash.

					</div>
					<p>
						Black Flash is a distortion in space that occurs when
						cursed energy is applied within 0.000001 seconds of a
						physical hit. When a sorcerer is able to achieve this,
						their cursed energy flashes black, and the destructive
						power of their strike is equal to a normal hit to the
						power of 2.5.
					</p>
					<p>
						This technique is not too disimilar Yuji's Divergent
						Fist. However, when it comes to black flash, you are
						expected to control the flow of cursed energy so well
						that it is applied within 0.000001 seconds. Which is
						almost equal to zero.
					</p>

					<p>
						Black Flash can be thought of as what athletes refer to
						as the “zone”. This is due to the fact that it increases
						their chances of landing a heavy attack, increases the
						power of their follow-up attacks, and it increase the
						probability that they will hit their opponent with
						another Black Flash attack.
					</p>

					<p>
						Jujutsu sorcerers need to have an excellent
						understanding of cursed energy and incredible
						concentration to land a Black Flash. For this reason, it
						is usually uncommon amongst sorcerers. Contrary to how
						“uncommon” it is, Black Flash is still more commonly
						used by special-grade or higher-grade jujutsu sorcerers.
					</p>

					<div class="img-flex">
						<img
							class="img-block-3"

					</div>

					<p>
						Unleashing Black Flash requires incredible concentration
						and no jujutsu sorcerer is capable of using doing so at
						will, not even Satoru Gojo. It does not occur randomly
						and requires immense skill and combat potential to pull
						off.
					</p>

					<p>
						Jujutsu users who manage to unleash Black Flash
						immediately gain an immeasurably higher understanding of
						the essence of cursed energy when compared to someone
						who has never used it.
					</p>

					<p>
						Anyone who succeeds in landing Black Flash will
						temporarily enter a state of increased cursed energy
						awareness, where the mental process of manipulating
						cursed energy becomes as simple as breathing for them.
						This leads to a greatly increased performance in combat,
						allowing the user to operate at 120% of their maximum
						potential.

					<p>
						Nanami believes that using Black Flash consecutive times
						isn't anything to celebrate. After unleashing Black
						Flash more than once, doing so repeatedly becomes a much
						easier task.
					</p>

					<p>
						Nanami's record four consecutive Black Flashes were
						against cursed spirits during the Night Parade of a
						Hundred Demons in Kyoto.

						During the Goodwill Event, Aoi Todo was able to teach
						Yuji how to harness his cursed energy by properly timing
						it with his superhuman speed and strength. By explaining
						how to make his cursed energy flow properly and pitting
						Yuji against Hanami, Todo was able to help Yuji unleash
						Black Flash against the special grade curse.
					</p>

					<p>
						Yuji's first Black Flash dealt a great deal of damage to
						Hanami. While "in the zone" Yuji was able to land a rush
						of four Black Flashes that completely overpowered the
						special grade curse. This rush tied Kento Nanami's
						record of four consecutive Black Flash strikes.
					</p>

					<p>
						While fighting two-on-two against Eso & Kechizu, Yuji
						and Nobara both used Black Flash together to defeat the
						Death Paintings. Yuji's punch destroyed Eso's arm
						entirely, and so quickly that the special grade couldn't
						even react.

					<p>
						Yuji is not the only character to be seen using Black
						Flash. After emotionally breaking Yuji Itadori by near
						fatally injuring Nobara Kugisaki, Mahito landed a Black
						Flash strike on the unprepared Yuji, launching the boy
						across Shibuya Station and overwhelming him with
						numerous attacks. He once again used it against Aoi Todo
						after weakening him with Idle Transfiguration.

								Divergent Fist relies on the manipulation of

								energy to his moves. Thus, arises a delay or
								“lag”. He first hits with a bare minimum amount

								delivers two hits.

<!-- <p>
			Yuji was created by Gege Akutami. His name is rife with
			symbolisim. Itadori is a rare word in Kanji. It is
			seldom written the way Akutami writes it. When written
			in this manner Itadori roughly translates to take away
			pain. Akutami chose this name as it is befitting a
			character whose primary objective is to help others.
			Just as Yuji's name is rife with symbolic meaning, his
			clothing likewise serves a symbolic purpose. Akutami
			purposly chose to have Itadori as the only sorcerer in
			the series who is seen wearing a hood. Akutami stated in
			an interview that Yuj's unique Jujutsu high uniform was
			meant to symbolize his hesitancy and indecisiveness.
		</p>
		<p>
			The author of the Jujutsu Kaisen series, Gege Akutami,
			revealed that Yuji Itadori will die by the end of the
			manga. Gege Akutami wrote Yuji as the embodiment of how
			painful and depressing the lives of jujutsu sorcerers
			can be. While these sorcerers must put their lives on
			the line they are simultaneously burdened by the
			inevitable deaths of everyone they get close to. Itadori
			serves as an amalgamation of the life that every jujutsu
			sorcerer is destined to lead.
		</p>

		<p>
			Shortly after his grandfathers death he encounters
			Megumi, a sorcerer who was battling a cursed spirit at
			the time. When he and Megumi were under the threat of
			being killed by a curse, Yuji impulsively swallowed
			Sukuna's finger to exorcise the curse and save them
			despite having met Megumi for the first time on that
			day. Yuji's sacrafice demonstrated one of his defining
			traits in the series. That trait being his willingness
			to sacrifice himself for others, which was triggered by
			his grandfather's last words to him.

			<p>
				Yuji's character is defined by his desire to
				aide those in need while simultaneously seeing
				the best in others, regardless of what they've
				done in the past. Yuji's name in kanji serves as a
				symbolic refernce to his desire to
				aide those in need. In

					Cursed energy is born from negative
					emotions such as grief and anger. These
					negative feelings are common in human
					society so almost everyone possesses
					cursed energy. If this amount is higher
					than a certain degree, it grants the
					person the ability to see curses, which
					is very rare among the human race.
				</p>

				<p>
					Curses are apparitions manifested
					entirely from cursed energy. Even their
					bodies are composed of cursed energy,
					making cursed spirits invisible to
					non-sorcerers. Jujutsu related items
					such as cursed tools, cursed objects,
					and cursed corpses all contain cursed
					energy. The emission of cursed energy
					from humans collects like sediment until
					a cursed spirit is born from the
					collective negative energy.
				</p>

				<div class="modal-img">

				<p>
					Curses born with strong feelings
					directed toward a certain aspect are
					especially strong. The stronger
					humanity's fear and anger is directed at
					cursing a certain aspect of the world,
					like natural disasters, the more
					powerful curses spawned from those
					negative sentiments will be.
				</p>

				<div class="modal-img">
					<img
						class="img-static"

				</div>

				<p>
					Proper control over one's emotions is
					key to channeling cursed energy and
					every jujutsu sorcerer is trained to do
					so. This makes it so sorcerers don't
					waste their power supply even while
					they're overcome with emotion.

				<div class="modal-gif">

				<p>
					Sorcerers leak far less cursed energy
					than the average human. So much so, that
					if every human were a sorcerer, curses
					would cease to spawn. There are other
					differences in how sorcerers and
					non-sorcerers use cursed energy due to
					their profession, but the real reason
					lies in how it flows. While cursed
					energy leaks outward from non-sorcerers,
					it flows heavily within sorcerers which
					keeps it contained
				</p>

				<p>
					Applying cursed energy to physical
					attacks can be as effective as a cursed
					technique when it comes to gifted
					combatants who prefer close quarters.
					Yuji can fight on par with that of a
					grade 1 sorcerer without a technique due
					to his ability to seemlessly imbue his
					physical attacks with cursed energy.
				</p>

				<p>
					Control over cursed energy requires
					innate skill and vigorous training. In
					order for Yuji to develop his skills,
					Gojo had him undergo special training
					that saw him controlling his emotions
					and his cursed energy at the same time.

					Yuji's cursed energy originates from the

					opening episode; as that finger belonged
					to the special grade curse, Ryomen
					Sukuna.
				</p>
				<p>
					Although Yuji has not developed an
					innate technique, he has shown great
					proficiency in learning how to control
					cursed energy. Currently, Yuji primarily
					uses cursed energy combined with his
					martial arts skills and superhuman
					strength. Yuji reinforces his strikes
					with cursed energy, increasing their
					impact and allowing him to hurt curses.

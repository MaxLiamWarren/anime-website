						Thus far their have been twelve events, otherwise known

						manga. Below is an examination of a fraction of those
						twelve events. The events covered are solely taken from
						season one of the anime. These events were critical to
						Yuji's development as a jujutsu sorcerer. They allowed
						him to hone the basic principals of jujutsu through
						combat that often times forced Yuji to go beyond what he
						thought he was capable of. Not only were these events
						crtical to Yuji's physical development but they
						similarly strengthened Yuji's resolve in his ideals.

						Nobara are tasked with rescuing potential survivors
						trapped in the cursed womb. By the time they arrive, the
						cursed womb has already produced a special grade cursed
						spirit and slaughtered all the inhabitants of the remote
						detention facility. Megumi believes that the inmates
						can't be redeemed or saved, prompting an argument with
						Yuji. Nobara is then suddenly separated from them and
						the special grade curse appears from nowhere. Yuji and
						Megumi are both stricken with fear due to the sudden

					The King of Curses agrees to repair Yuji under the condition

					<p class="events-sub-head-paragraph-style">
						The Vs. Mahito Arc is the third arc in Gege Akutami's
						Jujutsu Kaisen series. It follows Yuji and grade 1
						sorcerer, Kento Nanami as they investigate Mahito's
						trail of transfigured human corpses. Mahito involves a
						disheartened young man named Junpei Yoshino, leading him
						down a dark path. This Arc is possibly the most
						important arc in all of season one. For the first time
						Yuji is core principals are challenged. The events of
						this arc force Yuji to reevaluate how he's going to save
						those he cares about while learning to grow as a jujutsu
						sorcerer. The arc begins with the introduction of Junpei
						Yoshino, who is enjoying a movie at Kinema Cinema.
						Junpei is a student from Satozakura High School, who has
						the misfortune of witnessing the brutal demise of his
						fellow classmates. They're gruesomely transfigured by
						the hands of the special grade cursed spirit Mahito.
						Rather than being fearful, Junpei follows Mahito out of
						the theater and makes his acquaintance. At the same
						time, having finished his training with Gojo sensei,
						Yuji is assigned to help grade 1 sorcerer, Kento Nanami.
						They arrive on the scene together to investigate the
						murders at Kinema Cinema. The culprit is already gone,
						but they investigate the premises to find two strange
						curses lurking on the roof.
					</p>
				</div>

				<p class="events-sub-head-paragraph-style">
					Yuji is eager to prove the fruits of his labor but Nanami
					wants the young man not to go overboard. He doesn't
					recognize Yuji as a full-blown sorcerer and views him as a
					child. Yuji uses his newly developed Divergent Fist and
					Nanami uses his Ratio Technique to easily dispatch the
					curses. Nanami takes a photo to confirm his suspicions
					before bringing the corpses back to Doctor Shoko. She
					discovers that these aren't curses, instead, they're humans
					who were transfigured by cursed energy.
				</p>

				<p class="events-sub-head-paragraph-style">
					Inside Mahito's lair, the curse appears to have taken a
					liking to Junpei and explains the nature of his existence.
					Mahito feels that he was born from the hate within people
					and taps into the dark side of Junpei's mind. Junpei is a
					timid boy who is constantly tormented by bully's at school.
					This has lead to him developing a deep hatred for other
					humans. It is this pain that Mahito uses to manipulate
					Junpei into committing unspeakable acts.

						behind by the murders. Nanami decides to send Yuji to
						question the only known witness at the theater, Junpei.
						Nanami decides to try and track down the cursed spirit
						using the residual cursed energy that Mahito left
						behind. However, Mahito left behind residuals of his
						cursed energy as an open invitation to the jujutsu
						sorcerers. Rather than putting Yuji in harm's way,
						Nanami infiltrates Mahito's lair alone. They fight using
						their cursed techniques and Nanami manages to break
						Mahito's guard. Mahito reveals that his ability allows
						him to re-shape souls, including his own. This makes
						Mahito capable of healing himself as well as
						transfiguring others. Rendering Nanami's assaults
						useless, Mahito takes the upper hand in the bout and
						injures Nanami by touching his soul. At this point
						Nanami goes into overtime and manages to crush Mahito by
						imploading the surrounding area. However, Nanami notes
						that Mahito most likely survived.

				<p class="events-sub-head-paragraph-style">
					Yuji manages to talk with Junpei at his school and despite
					their clashing personalities, they manage to bond over
					movies. They're found by Junpei's mother, Nagi Yoshino, who
					invites Yuji to dinner. He accepts the offer and eats at the
					Yoshino house, managing to get along very well with Junpei
					and his mom. That night, Junpei asks Yuji if he's prepared
					to kill as a jujutsu sorcerer. Yuji admits that he knows the
					choice will present itself but wants to believe that he
					won't devalue human life. After Yuji leaves, Nagi finds one
					of Sukuna's finger on the table, attracting curses that
					murder her. Those close to Junpei learn of his mother's
					death, including Mahito and Yuji.

						Junpei interrupts the event, knocking out everyone in
						the gym and attacking Shota with the cursed techniques
						he learned from Mahito. Outside, Mahito and Suguru Geto
						plan on using Junpei to draw out Yuji and Sukuna. Yuji
						learns about the commotion at the high school and goes
						alone despite Ijichi's misgivings. Yuji finds Junpei
						assaulting Shota and stops him. Junpei tells Yuji to
						stop acting compassionately because it's all lies and
						people don't have hearts. Yuji feels that Junpei's words
						are an empty attempt to hide his pain and overpowers by
						attacking Junpei rather than the shikigami. Junpei can't
						believe that people have hearts, because someone cursed
						his mother. He breaks down into tears and uses his
						shikigami to attack again. This time, Yuji allows
						himself to be pierced in order to get through to Junpei.
						Yuji promises to help Junpei find out who killed his
						mother if the latter will join Jujutsu High. Just as
						Yuji reaches Junpei's heart, Mahito arrives.

				<p class="events-sub-head-paragraph-style">
					Mahito pins down Yuji and the latter realizes that this is
					the curse Nanami fought. Junpei tries to tell Yuji to stand
					down and then realizes that Mahito has been an evil person
					all this time. Just as he puts the pieces together about his
					mother's murder, Junpei is transfigured by Mahito. Mahito
					forces Junpei to fight Yuji, trying to force the human boy
					to rely on Sukuna. However, Sukuna refuses to heal Junpei
					and both curses laugh at Yuji's expense. Junpei dies and
					Yuji realizes that he has no choice but to accept the truth.
					Mahito and Sukuna are nothing but curses. This forces Yuji
					to come to terms with the fact that he may not be able to
					help everyone. He's confronted by the reality of life as a
					Jujutsu sorcerer. That life being one of great pain, one in
					which he will watch countless more loved ones perish. Yuji
					is tormented by the fact that he couldn't save Junpei or his
					mother and has doubts about helping people to a natural
					death. What ensues is an intense battle. Nanami and Yuji
					manage to injure Mahito, however, in the end he manages to
					escape. Still plagued by his hatred for Mahito, Yuji swears
					never to lose again until he destroys Junpei's killer.

						incarnated Cursed Womb: Death Paintings.

				<p class="events-sub-head-paragraph-style">
					Yuji, Megumi, and Nobara are assigned a mission to
					investigate the mysterious deaths involving the victims.
					Each of whom died by their doorways under similar
					circumstances, where the entrances to their homes were left
					open with a curse waiting there to kill them. Supervised by
					Akari Nitta, the first-years' investigation takes them to
					Megumi's alma matter at Saitama Urami East Junior High.
					There, the sorcerers discover that the cursed victims all
					share an incident where they were found unconscious beneath
					Yasohachi Bridge. At the same time, Mahito and Suguru Geto
					plant the Cursed Womb: Death Paintings into human vessels,
					allowing them to incarnate. After checking in with Ijichi
					and running the info by him, Megumi realizes the danger of
					the Yasohachi Bridge curse and tries to investigate it on
					his own. Despite Megumi's concerns, Yuji and Nobara

					<p class="events-sub-head-paragraph-style">
						Megumi deduces the correct sequence of conditions to
						pass through the curses barrier beneath the bridge and
						the three first-years cross over into its domain. They
						discover the Yashohachi Bridge curse is a mole-like
						monster that pokes its head out rapidly from several
						exits. Just before the exorcism begins, Kechizu abruptly
						enters the barrier behind the sorcerers. While Yuji
						deals with Kechizu, Megumi and Nobara attempt to
						exorcise the other curse. Another party is added to the
						chaos when Kechizu's older brother, Eso, takes Nobara
						out of the Domain. He reveals that the Death Paintings
						have been assigned with retrieving Sukuna's finger.
						Megumi exorcises the mole curse and discovers that
						another finger bearer just like the one at the Detention
						Center has been hidden in the barrier. Megumi battles
						the Finger Bearer and quickly learns this one is far
						more powerful than the previous curse. He recalls
						training with Gojo and how he needs to imagine a better
						version of himself instead of trying to match of up to
						Yuji. After being battered by the curse, Megumi lets go
						of his restraints and lets his cursed energy flow
						freely, manifesting his own Domain Expansion for the
						first time. Shattering his limits, Megumi defeats the
						special grade curse and proves he's far stronger than
						he's been giving himself credit for.

				<p class="events-sub-head-paragraph-style">
					Yuji and Nobara initially evade danger but are both
					eventually struck by the Death Paintings' poison blood.
					Infected with the decomposing effect of Rot Technique
					Maximum: Decay, Nobara has no choice but to impale herself
					with Resonance to counter. It's effective, injuring both
					brothers at the same time as Nobara invites them to play a
					deadly game of chicken.

						Using Straw Doll Technique: Resonance to stun the Death

						pummel Kechizu with brute force. This leverages Eso into
						undoing the Decay technique to save his younger brother.
						Shortly after, the focus granted to them by the pain
						from the toxic blood allows Yuji and Nobara to tap into
						the sparks of black. They unleash Black Flash in their
						next attacks, critically injuring both brothers. Kechizu
						makes one last attempt to strike Nobara down but he's
						exorcised by Nobara's Hairpin attack. She tells Eso not
						to worry because he'll be joining his brother soon. As
						Eso cries for his fallen brother, Yuji and Nobara
						realize the gravity of killing someone that is flesh and
						blood. The injured Eso attempts to make a daring escape
						by taking a hostage aboard a speeding truck, but Nobara
						stops him by using Resonance on his severed arm. Yuji
						finishes the fight, apologizing before delivering the
						final blow that ends Eso for good.

					Following the fighting, Yuji and Nobara take a moment to
					reflect on killing flesh and blood people. Despite being

					agree that they're accomplices in the murder of two

<!-- <p>
			Yuji was created by Gege Akutami. His name is rife with
			symbolisim. Itadori is a rare word in Kanji. It is
			seldom written the way Akutami writes it. When written
			in this manner Itadori roughly translates to take away
			pain. Akutami chose this name as it is befitting a
			character whose primary objective is to help others.
			Just as Yuji's name is rife with symbolic meaning, his
			clothing likewise serves a symbolic purpose. Akutami
			purposly chose to have Itadori as the only sorcerer in
			the series who is seen wearing a hood. Akutami stated in
			an interview that Yuj's unique Jujutsu high uniform was
			meant to symbolize his hesitancy and indecisiveness.
		</p>
		<p>
			The author of the Jujutsu Kaisen series, Gege Akutami,
			revealed that Yuji Itadori will die by the end of the
			manga. Gege Akutami wrote Yuji as the embodiment of how
			painful and depressing the lives of jujutsu sorcerers
			can be. While these sorcerers must put their lives on
			the line they are simultaneously burdened by the
			inevitable deaths of everyone they get close to. Itadori
			serves as an amalgamation of the life that every jujutsu
			sorcerer is destined to lead.
		</p>

		<p>
			Shortly after his grandfathers death he encounters
			Megumi, a sorcerer who was battling a cursed spirit at
			the time. When he and Megumi were under the threat of
			being killed by a curse, Yuji impulsively swallowed
			Sukuna's finger to exorcise the curse and save them
			despite having met Megumi for the first time on that
			day. Yuji's sacrafice demonstrated one of his defining
			traits in the series. That trait being his willingness
			to sacrifice himself for others, which was triggered by
			his grandfather's last words to him.

			<p>Yuji</p>
			<p>
				Yuji's character is defined by his desire to
				aide those in need while simultaneously seeing
				the best in others, regardless of what they've
				done in the past. Yuji's name in kanji serves as a
				symbolic refernce to his desire to
				aide those in need. In
				kanji Yuji means “unchanging kindness” or
				“unwavering humanity”.

					Cursed energy is born from negative
					emotions such as grief and anger. These
					negative feelings are common in human
					society so almost everyone possesses
					cursed energy. If this amount is higher
					than a certain degree, it grants the
					person the ability to see curses, which
					is very rare among the human race.
				</p>

				<p>
					Curses are apparitions manifested
					entirely from cursed energy. Even their
					bodies are composed of cursed energy,
					making cursed spirits invisible to
					non-sorcerers. Jujutsu related items
					such as cursed tools, cursed objects,
					and cursed corpses all contain cursed
					energy. The emission of cursed energy
					from humans collects like sediment until
					a cursed spirit is born from the
					collective negative energy.
				</p>

				<div class="modal-img">

				<p>
					Curses born with strong feelings
					directed toward a certain aspect are
					especially strong. The stronger
					humanity's fear and anger is directed at
					cursing a certain aspect of the world,
					like natural disasters, the more
					powerful curses spawned from those
					negative sentiments will be.
				</p>

				<div class="modal-img">
					<img
						class="img-static"

				</div>

				<p>
					Proper control over one's emotions is
					key to channeling cursed energy and
					every jujutsu sorcerer is trained to do
					so. This makes it so sorcerers don't
					waste their power supply even while
					they're overcome with emotion.
				</p>

				<div class="modal-gif">

				<p>
					Sorcerers leak far less cursed energy
					than the average human. So much so, that
					if every human were a sorcerer, curses
					would cease to spawn. There are other
					differences in how sorcerers and
					non-sorcerers use cursed energy due to
					their profession, but the real reason
					lies in how it flows. While cursed
					energy leaks outward from non-sorcerers,
					it flows heavily within sorcerers which
					keeps it contained
				</p>

				<p>
					Applying cursed energy to physical
					attacks can be as effective as a cursed
					technique when it comes to gifted
					combatants who prefer close quarters.
					Yuji can fight on par with that of a
					grade 1 sorcerer without a technique due
					to his ability to seemlessly imbue his
					physical attacks with cursed energy.
				</p>

				<p>
					Control over cursed energy requires
					innate skill and vigorous training. In
					order for Yuji to develop his skills,
					Gojo had him undergo special training
					that saw him controlling his emotions
					and his cursed energy at the same time.

				<p>
					Yuji's cursed energy originates from the
					cursed finger that he consume in the
					opening episode; as that finger belonged
					to the special grade curse, Ryomen
					Sukuna.
				</p>
				<p>
					Although Yuji has not developed an
					innate technique, he has shown great
					proficiency in learning how to control
					cursed energy. Currently, Yuji primarily
					uses cursed energy combined with his
					martial arts skills and superhuman
					strength. Yuji reinforces his strikes
					with cursed energy, increasing their
					impact and allowing him to hurt curses.

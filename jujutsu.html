							While any member of the Gojo family can inherit the
							Limitless, only those who also possess the six eyes

							The six eyes provides the user with vast perception

							precisely manipulate the sophisticated powers of the
							Limitless down to an atomic level. Each of the

							cursed energy manipulation, making the pairing of
							the six eyes crucial to utilizing the Limitless'

							The six eyes allows the user to see cursed energy in

							differentiate between different types of cursed
							energy and help the user identify a person based on
							it.
						</li>

						<br />

						<li>
							The six eyes can be used to set the Limitless
							Infinity ability to automatic. This allows the user
							to instantly read an incoming projectile danger
							using it's mass, speed, and shape among other
							factors. By simultaneously using the six eyes to
							calculate a reverse cursed technique automatically,
							the user can also keep their brain fresh at all

						Infinity is the base state of the Limitless and is

						operates the same way convergent and divergent sequences
						do in mathematics. The Infinity is the convergence of an
						immeasurable series, anything that approaches the
						infinity slows down and never reaches the user. This is
						because the technique takes the finite amount of space
						between the two subjects and divides it an infinite
						amount of times.
					</p>
					<ul class="main-section-paragraph-secondary">
						<li>
							In mathematics, no matter how many times someone
							divides a number it will never be reduced to zero.
							Instead, they will be left with fractional units so

							so anything that attempts to penetrate this
							infinitely divided space will slow down to the point
							of appearing to stop completely.
						</li>
						<br />

						<li>
							The invisible barrier created by the Infinity can be
							expanded to keep harmful substances away from the
							user , or to overpower someone attempting to
							neutralize their technique. The Infinity can only be

						the user's cursed energy, which can cause the user to
						tire out easily.
					</p>
					<ul class="main-section-paragraph-secondary">
						<li>
							Blue is the Cursed Technique Lapse of the Limitless,
							which increases the cursed energy output of the
							technique and generates the power to attract. This
							is achieved by amplifying the Limitless and bringing
							the conceptual impossibility of negative distance
							into reality. This forces the surrounding space to
							try and fill in the gap by pulling violently toward
							the source of the aforementioned impossibility,
							creating the magnetic-like effect.
						</li>
						<br />

						<li>
							Anyone who is targeted directly with blue will have
							their body implode and their limbs instantly
							crushed. Blue can also be used to attract two
							targets to one another across wide distances. This
							same effect can also be used to move the user at
							high speeds, so fast that it makes them appear as if
							they're teleporting.
						</li>

						<br />

						<li>
							<strong>
								Maximum Cursed Energy Output Blue:
							</strong>
							A highly amplified version of Blue unleashed when

					<p class="main-section-paragraph-primary">
						The reverse Limitless technique is powered by positive
						reverse cursed energy as opposed to negative cursed
						energy. This reverses the effect of the strengthened
						Limitless, producing a strong repelling effect rather
						than an attracting one.
					</p>
					<ul class="main-section-paragraph-secondary">
						<li>
							The technique manifests itself as a small, but
							extremely bright red orb on the tip of the user's
							finger, representing the very essence of convergence
							and divergence brought into reality. When released,
							the explosive output is massive, creating a gigantic
							shockwave that blows everything away without
							prejudice. The overall cursed energy output from Red
							is more than twice that of the strengthened
							Limitless, Cursed Technique Lapse: Blue.
						</li>
						<br />

						<li>
							Generating the reverse cursed energy needed for Red
							is extremely difficult. It requires an even more
							complex manipulation of cursed energy than usual,
							making pulling of cursed technique reversal even
							more sophisticated than using cursed technique
							lapse. The user must multiply their negative energy
							by negative energy in order to create positive
							energy, a simple concept that proves to be extremely
							difficult in practice. Being able to use a reverse
							cursed technique is extremely complicated for any
							sorcerer, even the most gifted of the Gojo Family.
						</li>

						<br />

						<li>
							<strong> Reverse cursed technique: </strong>
							Satoru was only able to unlock the ability to use a
							reverse cursed technique after surviving his
							near-death encounter with Toji Fushiguro. He
							discovered the core of cursed energy and learned to
							pour reverse cursed energy into his Limitless
							technique. This allowed him to successfully utilize

						<strong>Hollow Purple:</strong> is the colliding
						Limitless, an exceptionally powerful secret extension
						technique only known to a few in the Gojo Family. This
						technique brings the concept of motion and reversal into
						reality. Purple is born from merging both infinites:
						Blue and Red, to produce an imaginary mass that rushes
						forth and erases everything in its path.
					</p>
					<ul class="main-section-paragraph-secondary">
						<li>
							It is initiated by a hand sign that extends the
							index and pinky fingers outward while leaving the
							rest folded. Purple is unleashed when the sign
							switches to a pinching motion using the pointer and
							thumb while also extending the middle finger. Rather
							than the attraction of Blue or the repulsion of Red,
							Purple is an extraordinarily destructive energy wave
							of annihilation that rips whatever it hits from
							existence.
						</li>
						<br />

						<li>
							<strong> Extension technique: </strong>
							Until his second confrontation with Toji Fushiguro,
							Satoru was always unable to use Red and therefore
							never had access to use Purple. Only after the true
							power of the Limitless was awakened within Satoru
							could he utilize Red and potentially Purple. Toji
							was from the Zenin Family and had information on how
							to counter Red and Blue. Purple is a secret even
							within the Gojo Family that few know about. Toji was
							oblivious to the fact that Satoru could unleash such
							a devastating attack and suffered a direct hit,
							completely destroying the left side of his body.

						This Domain Expansion brings the user and their targets
						inside the Limitless itself, a vast void of infinite
						knowledge. Boundless raw information floods into the
						target's mind, overwhelming them to the point where
						they're completely immobilized.
					</p>
					<ul class="main-section-paragraph-secondary">
						<li>
							The complete incapacitation of the target is caused
							by a phenomenon where the target will be able to see
							and feel everything while not being able to see or
							feel anything at the same time. All the actions one
							has taken in their life is forced upon them
							infinitely and they can't do anything but die
							slowly. This effect does not affect the user or
							anyone they're touching with no intent to harm.
						</li>
						<br />

						<li>
							Unlimited Void is one of, if not the most advanced
							technique in the arsenal of the Limitless. Satoru
							Gojo inherited the Six Eyes and likely mastered his
							Domain Expansion after awakening his full potential
							after the Star Plasma Vessel escort mission. He
							first displayed his mastery over his domain when he
							used it to counter Jogo's Coffin of the Iron
							Mountain. Unlimited Void was the more refined of the
							two domains and easily supressed Coffin of the Iron
							Mountain.
						</li>

						<br />

						<li>
							Being trapped inside the Limitless left Jogo in a
							complete trance, to the point where he couldn't move
							at all and could hardly think clearly. He could only
							think of how he was helpless due to the endless
							information invading his mind. Satoru divulged how
							Unlimited Void forces one's actions upon them
							infinitely and noted how it was ironic how the
							target is given everything and yet unable to do
							anything at all.

				Limitless, which increases the cursed energy
				output of the technique and generates the power
				to attract. This is achieved by amplifying the
				Limitless and bringing the conceptual
				impossibility of negative distance into reality.
				This forces the surrounding space to try and
				fill in the gap by pulling violently toward the
				source of the aforementioned impossibility,
				creating the magnetic-like effect.
			</li>
			<br />

			<li>
				Anyone who is targeted directly with blue will
				have their body implode and their limbs
				instantly crushed. Blue can also be used to
				attract two targets to one another across wide
				distances. This same effect can also be used to
				move the user at high speeds, so fast that it
				makes them appear as if they're teleporting.

				<strong>
					Maximum Cursed Energy Output Blue:
				</strong>
				A highly amplified version of Blue unleashed
				when its been charged to its full power in order
				to achieve maximum cursed energy output. This
				produces a gigantic field of attraction capable
				of clearing out an entire area.

			Reversed Limitless: Red
		</header>
		<p class="main-section-paragraph-primary">
			The reverse Limitless technique is powered by
			positive reverse cursed energy as opposed to
			negative cursed energy. This reverses the effect of
			the strengthened Limitless, producing a strong
			repelling effect rather than an attracting one.
		</p>
		<ul class="main-section-paragraph-secondary">
			<li>
				The technique manifests itself as a small, but
				extremely bright red orb on the tip of the
				user's finger, representing the very essence of
				convergence and divergence brought into reality.
				When released, the explosive output is massive,
				creating a gigantic shockwave that blows
				everything away without prejudice. The overall
				cursed energy output from Red is more than twice
				that of the strengthened Limitless, Cursed
				Technique Lapse: Blue.
			</li>
			<br />

			<li>
				Generating the reverse cursed energy needed for
				Red is extremely difficult. It requires an even
				more complex manipulation of cursed energy than
				usual, making pulling of cursed technique
				reversal even more sophisticated than using
				cursed technique lapse. The user must multiply
				their negative energy by negative energy in
				order to create positive energy, a simple
				concept that proves to be extremely difficult in
				practice. Being able to use a reverse cursed
				technique is extremely complicated for any
				sorcerer, even the most gifted of the Gojo
				Family.
			</li>

			<br />

			<li>
				<strong> Reverse cursed technique: </strong>
				Satoru was only able to unlock the ability to
				use a reverse cursed technique after surviving
				his near-death encounter with Toji Fushiguro. He
				discovered the core of cursed energy and learned
				to pour reverse cursed energy into his Limitless
				technique. This allowed him to successfully
				utilize red in his rematch with Toji.

			Hollow Technique: Purple

		<p class="main-section-paragraph-primary">
			<strong>Hollow Purple:</strong> is the colliding
			Limitless, an exceptionally powerful secret
			extension technique only known to a few in the Gojo
			Family. This technique brings the concept of motion
			and reversal into reality. Purple is born from
			merging both infinites: Blue and Red, to produce an
			imaginary mass that rushes forth and erases
			everything in its path.
		</p>
		<ul class="main-section-paragraph-secondary">
			<li>
				It is initiated by a hand sign that extends the
				index and pinky fingers outward while leaving
				the rest folded. Purple is unleashed when the
				sign switches to a pinching motion using the
				pointer and thumb while also extending the
				middle finger. Rather than the attraction of
				Blue or the repulsion of Red, Purple is an
				extraordinarily destructive energy wave of
				annihilation that rips whatever it hits from
				existence.
			</li>
			<br />

			<li>
				<strong> Extension technique: </strong>
				Until his second confrontation with Toji
				Fushiguro, Satoru was always unable to use Red
				and therefore never had access to use Purple.
				Only after the true power of the Limitless was
				awakened within Satoru could he utilize Red and
				potentially Purple. Toji was from the Zenin
				Family and had information on how to counter Red
				and Blue. Purple is a secret even within the
				Gojo Family that few know about. Toji was
				oblivious to the fact that Satoru could unleash
				such a devastating attack and suffered a direct
				hit, completely destroying the left side of his
				body.

			Domain Expansion: Unlimited Void
		</header>
		<p class="main-section-paragraph-primary">
			This Domain Expansion brings the user and their
			targets inside the Limitless itself, a vast void of
			infinite knowledge. Boundless raw information floods
			into the target's mind, overwhelming them to the
			point where they're completely immobilized.
		</p>
		<ul class="main-section-paragraph-secondary">
			<li>
				The complete incapacitation of the target is
				caused by a phenomenon where the target will be
				able to see and feel everything while not being
				able to see or feel anything at the same time.
				All the actions one has taken in their life is
				forced upon them infinitely and they can't do
				anything but die slowly. This effect does not
				affect the user or anyone they're touching with
				no intent to harm.
			</li>
			<br />

			<li>
				Unlimited Void is one of, if not the most
				advanced technique in the arsenal of the
				Limitless. Satoru Gojo inherited the Six Eyes
				and likely mastered his Domain Expansion after
				awakening his full potential after the Star
				Plasma Vessel escort mission. He first displayed
				his mastery over his domain when he used it to
				counter Jogo's Coffin of the Iron Mountain.
				Unlimited Void was the more refined of the two
				domains and easily supressed Coffin of the Iron
				Mountain.
			</li>

			<br />

			<li>
				Being trapped inside the Limitless left Jogo in
				a complete trance, to the point where he
				couldn't move at all and could hardly think
				clearly. He could only think of how he was
				helpless due to the endless information invading
				his mind. Satoru divulged how Unlimited Void
				forces one's actions upon them infinitely and
				noted how it was ironic how the target is given
				everything and yet unable to do anything at all.
